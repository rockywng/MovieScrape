# MovieScrape
MovieScrape uses the BeautifulSoup package and the requests library to retrieve and analyze data from Wikipedia for user inputted films. 

## Motivation
Web scraping is a skill that those working with data often use, and has many practical applications. I wanted to apply the skills I learned relating to web scraping to a project. I decided to use web scraping to fetch casting information for movies because I often find that, as I'm watching a film or TV show, that I will recognize an actor but not be able to place their name, causing a mild annoyance.

## Usage
MovieScrape, in its current iteration, uses the python terminal to consume a user input and return an output. Simply run the python file found in this repository and a message will appear in the terminal asking for a movie name. Type in the name of the movie whose cast you would like to retrieve and click enter. After a second, the cast will be returned to you in the terminal.

## Possible Extensions
I will continue to work on this project to improve the user experience. Obviously shipping a product in this state wouldn't be a wise move, as users can't be expected to have to use the python terminal to use this service. I am currently in the process of debating whether to use the tkinter GUI toolkit or to attempt to build a web application, using pyjs and other web development tools.
